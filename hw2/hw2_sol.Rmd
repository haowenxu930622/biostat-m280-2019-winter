## Q1. Travis CI

1.**Solution:**

Continuous intergration include an automated build process and self-tesing 
elements within the repository that stores code.

The objective is to minimize the time between changes made to the code and the 
notification of this changes if this change would break the build.

2.**Solution:**

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PalEON-Project/stepps-baconizing.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PalEON-Project/stepps-baconizing)


## Q2. FizzBuzz Test

1.**Solution:**

In this question, I first created a vector and counting variable to take values 
from input, then parse through the command argument to store information to the 
variable I just created. The fizzbuzz function take an scalar or an vector as an
argument. To test if the criterion can be met, first, I test if the scalar or 
the element in the vector has a remainder of 0 when divided by 5 and 3 at the 
same time. Then, I tests if the remaind is equal to 0 when this number is 
divided by one of 3 or 5. If all of this requirement can not be met, it would 
output the number itself.

Here is my Q2.1 code:
```{R eval=FALSE}
#set up an empty vector to take values from input
nums <- vector()
#set up an counting variable
i <- 1
# parsing command arguments and store input into a vector
for (arg in commandArgs(TRUE)) {
  parse(text=arg)
  nums[i] <- eval(parse(text=arg))
  i <- i + 1
}
  
#fizzbuzz function
fizzbuzz <- function(nums=c(1:10)){
  for (j in nums){
    if (j %% 3 == 0 & j %% 5 == 0){
      print("FizzBuzz")
    }else if (j %% 3 == 0){
      print("Fizz")
    }else if (j %% 5 == 0){
      print("Buzz")
    }else{
      print(j)
    }
  }
}
#call function with the vector created from input
fizzbuzz(nums)
```


2.**Solution:**

Test run:
```{bash}
Rscript ./fizzbuzz.R 1 3 5 12
Rscript ./fizzbuzz.R 8.5 9.3 11.712
Rscript ./fizzbuzz.R 29410 1223231 312311
Rscript ./fizzbuzz.R 15/3 2/5 51/7 5+1 15-3 21-8
```
(The second command out put the actual number because the question only asked 
for interget input)


## Q3. Rcpp

**Solution:**

Here is my cpp code:
```{Rcpp}

```

Here is my R code:
```{R}

```

Test Run:
```{bash}

```
